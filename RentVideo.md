# RentVideo

**Problem Statement**

Develop a RESTful API service using Spring Boot to manage an online video rental system, while using MySQL to persist the data.

# Key Features

This is a simplified version of a video rental system. You should focus on implementing the specified features effectively while adhering to the following design principles:

* The service must implement authentication and authorization.  
* The service uses **Basic Auth** for authentication.  
* The service must have two roles: **CUSTOMER** and **ADMIN**.  
* The service must have two types of API endpoints:  
  * **Public endpoints**: Anyone can access them (e.g., Registration, Login).  
  * **Private endpoints**: Only authenticated users can access (e.g., Viewing available videos).  
  * Private endpoints must also enforce authorization, i.e., only specific roles can access certain endpoints (e.g., managing videos should only be allowed for the **ADMIN** role).

The **API** must have the following features:

## User Registration and Login

* Users must be able to register by providing their email address, password, and role.  
* The password must be hashed using BCrypt.  
* Fields: Email, Password, First Name, Last Name, Role.  
* The Role should default to **CUSTOMER** if not specified.  
* Registered users must log in using their email address and password (Basic Auth).

## Video Management

* The system must store and manage video details.  
* Fields: Title, Director, Genre, Availability Status (whether the video is available for rent or not).  
  * Assume that all videos are available to rent  
* Any user can browse the list of available videos.  
* Only the **ADMIN** is allowed to create, update, and delete videos.

# Endpoints

* Design RESTful endpoints based on the requirements

# Additional Requirements

* Handle common errors and return appropriate HTTP codes (e.g., 404, entity not found).  
* Unit tests for essential operations. (Optional).
